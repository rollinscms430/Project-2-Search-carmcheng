## Anagrams

Dictionary approach is exactly correct, with only two minor issues: printing the dictionary is impossible to read (as opposed to
printing each entry in a nice-ly formatted line), and your output includes several items that have only one entry, which can't really
be considerd "anagrams". I did enjoy learning that "poloists" and "topsoils" are anagrams.


## Word Ladders

Good. This is an interesting approach that builds, essentially, an entire graph model conencting realted words up front and then searches
it for the path from start to end.

## Boggle

Very good!
